== Description ==

This plugin notifies a comment author via email when someone replies to his comment.

== Requirements ==
* PHP 7.0+
* Wordpress 4.4+

== Installation ==

How to install the plugin:

1. Upload the ZIP file to your Wordpress installation directory
2. Extract the ZIP file contents to the /wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. For better results, setup a plugin to send emails using SMTP.

== Warning ==

This plugin uses the "wp_insert_comment" hook, therefore, everytime a comment is created, a notification is likely to be sent. If you are importing comments into your blog, it's a good idea to disable this plugin.

== Customizing the email template

To customize the email template, copy the "templates" folder to your theme folder. The plugin will look for templates on the "/wp-content/themes/[THEME]/templates/cren/" folder; if a custom template is not found, then it will fallback to the default template.

== Changing the subscription checkbox label ==

The checkbox label can be changed with the `cren_comment_checkbox_label` filter. This way you can update the text to your taste and keep the plugin updated.

== Changing the GDPR checkbox label ==

The GDPR checkbox label can be changed with the `cren_gdpr_checkbox_label` filter. This way you can update the text to your taste and keep the plugin updated.

== Buy me a coffee/beer ==

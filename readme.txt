== Description ==

This plugin allows visitors to subscribe to get answers to their comments via e-mail.

== Installation ==

How to install the plugin:

1. Extract the contents of the package to the `/wp-content/plugins/comment-reply-email-notification` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. For better results, setup a plugin to send emails using SMTP.

== Warning ==

This plugin uses the "wp_insert_comment" hook, therefore, everytime a comment is created, a notification is likely to be sent. If you are importing comments into your blog, it's a good idea to disable this plugin.

== Sending e-mails does not work? ==

The plugin uses the standard WordPress e-mail function. If you have problems getting e-mails sent, you might try using plugins like https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/ to improve sending e-mails from your site.

== Customizing the layout of the checkboxes ==

The label next to the checkboxes don't contain a whitespace. Depending on your theme you might want to add a custom style like this to get a space between the checkbox and the label:

`
input#cren_subscribe_to_comment, input#cren_gdpr {
  margin-right: 0.5em;
}
`

The plugin does not add this style be default as it depends on your theme if this is neccessary.

== Customizing the email template ==

To customize the email template, copy the "templates" folder to your theme folder (a child theme should be used to avoid losing the custom templates when the theme is updated). The plugin will look for templates on the "/wp-content/themes/[THEME]/templates/cren/" folder; if a custom template is not found, then it will fallback to the default template.

== Changing the subscription checkbox label ==

The checkbox label can be changed with the `cren_comment_checkbox_label` filter. This way you can update the text to your taste and keep the plugin updated.

== Changing the GDPR checkbox label ==

The GDPR checkbox label can be changed with the `cren_gdpr_checkbox_label` filter. This way you can update the text to your taste and keep the plugin updated.

== Modifiying HTML output ==

Using the filters `cren_gdpr_checkbox_html` and `cren_comment_subscribe_html` you can modify the HTML output of the checkboxes if needed.

Example:

`add_filter('cren_gdpr_checkbox_html', function(string $html_output, string $label_text, string $privacy_policy_url): string {
    $html_output = '<div class="comment-form-gdpr-consent form-check mb-3"><input id="cren_gdpr" class="form-check-input" name="cren_gdpr" type="checkbox" value="yes" required checked><label for="cren_gdpr" class="form-check-label">' . $label_text . '<span class="text-danger fw-bold">*</span> (<a href="' . $privacy_policy_url . '" title="Privacy Policy" target="_blank" rel="internal">Privacy Policy</a>)</label></div>';

    return $html_output;
}, 10, 3);

add_filter('cren_comment_subscribe_html', function(string $html_output, string $label_text, bool $checked_default): string {
    $checked = $checked_default ? 'checked' : '';
    $html_output = '<div class="comment-form-email-consent form-check mb-3"><input id="cren_subscribe_to_comment" class="form-check-input" name="cren_subscribe_to_comment" type="checkbox" value="on" ' . $checked . '><label for="cren_subscribe_to_comment" class="form-check-label">' . $label_text . '</label></div>';

    return $html_output;
}, 10, 3);`
